# Advanced Phishing Scanner

A front-end web application built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to analyze URLs and message content for common indicators of phishing.

## üõ°Ô∏è Features

This tool performs a client-side analysis based on a set of common phishing tactics. It does **not** send data to any external server or API.

-   **URL Analysis**:
    -   Checks for insecure **HTTP** connections.
    -   Detects the use of known **URL shorteners** (e.g., bit.ly).
    -   Flags suspicious **Top-Level Domains** (TLDs) like `.vip`, `.xyz`, etc.
    -   Warns if the URL is a raw IP address.
-   **Content Analysis**:
    -   Scans message text for **urgency-creating keywords** (e.g., "suspend," "final notice").
-   **Sender Analysis**:
    -   Compares the **claimed sender** (e.g., "Amazon") against the domain in the URL to spot mismatches.
-   **Risk Assessment**:
    -   Provides a final summary (Low, Medium, High Risk) based on the findings.
